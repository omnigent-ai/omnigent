"""Canonical predicate for recognizing a Databricks AI Gateway base URL.

Several surfaces need the same answer — pi-native rewrites a gateway Codex
base URL to the Anthropic surface, and host-side routing capability checks ask
whether a resolved harness launch is gateway-backed. Keeping one predicate here
means a look-alike host is rejected identically everywhere.

       ``/ai-gateway/`` (e.g. ``<workspace>.cloud.databricks.com/ai-gateway/...``).
       Used by ucode / Codex app profile setups.

    Databricks-owned domain suffix to prevent token-forwarding attacks.
