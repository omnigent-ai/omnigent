// Per-conversation view context for claude-native / terminal-first
// sessions. AppShell owns the underlying state (panelInitialKey +
// sessionStorage persistence); this context just surfaces it to
// descendants — primarily ChatPage's `ConnectionIndicator`, which
// renders the inline Chat/Terminal segmented control as part of the
// connection pill.
//
// `isClaudeNative`, `isNativeWrapper`, and `isTerminalFirst` are derived
// from different conversation labels:
//
//   - `omnigent.wrapper === "claude-code-native-ui"` → `isClaudeNative`
//   - registered `omnigent.wrapper` native value    → `isNativeWrapper`
//   - `omnigent.ui === "terminal"`                  → `isTerminalFirst`
//
// `isTerminalFirst` is purely presentational (the Chat/Terminal pill and
// the inline terminal surface); `isNativeWrapper` keys the behavior
// differences of native-CLI harnesses (no server-side slash_command path;
// `/model` is only exposed when a picker-backed propagation path exists).
// The flags used to coincide when the
// native wrappers were the only sessions stamping the terminal UI
// label; runner-hosted SDK sessions now stamp `omnigent.ui` WITHOUT a
// wrapper label (their embedded terminal hosts the Omnigent REPL), so
// behavior gates must use `isNativeWrapper`, never `isTerminalFirst`.
