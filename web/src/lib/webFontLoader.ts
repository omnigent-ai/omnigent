// On-demand web font loader.
//
// Given a catalog entry (see lib/fontCatalog.ts), inject the stylesheet or
// `@font-face` rules that fetch its face data, then await readiness so callers
// know when glyphs are actually available (the moment to re-measure Monaco /
// refit xterm). Deduplicated on every axis:
//   - `bundled` fonts and empty families no-op (nothing to fetch).
//   - each stylesheet/asset is injected AT MOST ONCE, keyed by its resource URL
//     (NOT the catalog id) so two entries sharing one resource dedupe.
//   - concurrent loads of the same resource share one in-flight promise.
//
// Readiness is signalled ONLY by genuine `document.fonts.load` settlement — no
// timer resolves it. `document.fonts.load` is itself bounded (it settles when
// the browser's font fetch finishes or fails, per spec — it doesn't hang), and
// our two consumers never block on it: the UI font path fires-and-forgets (CSS
// `font-display: swap` paints the swap), and the code font path chains `.then`
// to re-emit only on a `true` result. So a wall-clock timeout would either fire
// a premature remeasure against the fallback cell (if reported as ready) or
// suppress the real late notification — the exact bugs it was meant to avoid.
// We deliberately omit it.
//
// SSR/no-DOM safe: with no `document`, load() resolves immediately (there's
// nothing to paint), so boot-time restore on the server is a harmless no-op.
