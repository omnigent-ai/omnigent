# Agent YAML spec

Omnigent can run an agent from a single YAML file:

```bash
omnigent run path/to/agent.yaml
```

Use this file to choose the harness/model, write the system prompt, and declare
which tools, sub-agents, OS access, and policies the agent can use.

## Minimal agent

```yaml
name: hello_agent
prompt: |
  You are a concise assistant. Answer directly and ask a follow-up question when
  the request is ambiguous.

executor:
  harness: claude-sdk
  model: databricks-claude-sonnet-4-6
  auth:
    type: databricks
    profile: oss
```

`prompt` may also be replaced by `instructions: AGENTS.md`; relative paths are
resolved from the YAML file's directory.

## Common top-level fields

| Field | Required? | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | Recommended | Stable identifier shown in sessions and logs. |
| `prompt` | Usually | Inline system prompt. |
| `instructions` | Optional | Inline instructions or a path to an instructions file. If set, it takes precedence over `prompt`. |
| `executor` | Recommended | Harness, model, and auth settings. |
| `tools` | Optional | MCP tools, Python function tools, sub-agents, handoffs, or inherited tools. |
| `policies` | Optional | Guardrails that inspect requests, responses, tool calls, or tool results. |
| `params` | Optional | Typed user parameters available to tools/skills. |
| `os_env` | Optional | Enables local OS tools such as file reads, writes, edits, and shell commands. |
| `terminals` | Optional | Named interactive terminal environments the agent can launch. |
| `async` | Optional | Whether async work tools are exposed. Defaults to `true`. |
| `cancellable` | Optional | Whether the session can be cancelled. Defaults to `true`. |
| `timers` | Optional | Whether timer tools are exposed. Defaults to `false`. |

## Executor

```yaml
executor:
  harness: claude-sdk        # claude-sdk, openai-agents, codex, cursor, kiro-native, pi, antigravity, qwen, copilot, ...
  model: databricks-claude-opus-4-7
  auth:
    type: databricks
    profile: oss             # Databricks profile for model routing
```

Set the Databricks profile under `executor.auth`. The older top-level
`executor.profile` shorthand is legacy and should not be used in new specs.

The `cursor` harness (Cursor's `cursor-agent`) is the exception: it talks
only to Cursor's own backend and has no custom API base-URL, so the Databricks
gateway / `auth.type: databricks` does not apply. Authenticate it with
`CURSOR_API_KEY` (or a prior `cursor-agent login`), optionally pinned via
`auth: {type: api_key, api_key: ${CURSOR_API_KEY}}`, and choose a Cursor model
id (e.g. `auto`, `gpt-5`) rather than a `databricks-*` id.

The `kiro-native` harness is the native Kiro CLI terminal path used by
`omnigent kiro`. It requires `kiro-cli` on `PATH` and Kiro's own login/auth; it
does not use Databricks, OpenAI, or Anthropic provider credentials. Plain
`harness: kiro` is not a generic Omnigent harness id.

### Antigravity (Gemini)

`harness: antigravity` runs the agent through Google's
[Antigravity SDK](https://pypi.org/project/google-antigravity/)
(`pip install "omnigent[antigravity]"`). It defaults to **Gemini 3.5 Flash**
and can also drive Claude / GPT-OSS. Authenticate with an Antigravity /
Gemini API key, or Vertex AI (`project` / `location`) — the SDK is
Gemini-native and has no OpenAI-compatible gateway / Databricks path.

```yaml
executor:
  harness: antigravity         # aliases: agy, google-antigravity
  model: gemini-3.5-flash
  auth:
    type: api_key
    api_key: ${GEMINI_API_KEY}     # or ANTIGRAVITY_API_KEY
```

### GitHub Copilot

`harness: copilot` runs the agent through the
[GitHub Copilot SDK](https://pypi.org/project/github-copilot-sdk/)
(`pip install "omnigent[copilot]"`). The SDK bundles the Copilot CLI it drives
as a backing server, so no separate CLI install is needed. Like cursor and
antigravity it talks only to GitHub's Copilot backend — there is no Databricks
gateway / `auth.type: databricks` path. Authenticate with a **GitHub token** that
carries Copilot access: a fine-grained PAT with the "Copilot Requests"
permission, or an OAuth token from the GitHub CLI (`gh auth token`) / Copilot
CLI. Resolution: spec `auth.api_key` → a token registered via `omnigent setup`
(the `copilot:` config block) → ambient `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN` / `GH_TOKEN` /
`GITHUB_TOKEN`. Choose a Copilot model id (e.g. `claude-haiku-4.5`, `gpt-5-mini`,
or omit for auto-select) rather than a `databricks-*` id. Classic `ghp_` PATs are
not accepted by Copilot.

```yaml
executor:
  harness: copilot             # alias: github-copilot
  model: claude-haiku-4.5      # a Copilot model id; omit for auto-select
  auth:
    type: api_key
    api_key: ${GH_TOKEN}       # a GitHub token with Copilot access
```

To route through OpenRouter / a gateway, declare a key/gateway provider in
`~/.omnigent/config.yaml` and reference it (`auth: {type: provider, name: …}`),
or set `auth.base_url` to the OpenAI-compatible endpoint alongside the key.
For Databricks, use `auth: {type: databricks, profile: …}`.

CLI flags such as `--harness` and `--model` can override or supply missing
executor values for a run. Databricks credentials come from the spec's
`executor.auth` block or your `omnigent setup` provider config — there is
no profile flag.

## Qwen Code

`harness: qwen` runs the agent through [Qwen Code](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen)
(`npm install -g @qwen-code/qwen-code`). It drives the `qwen` CLI in ACP mode
(`qwen --acp`).

```yaml
executor:
  harness: qwen                # aliases: qwen-code
  model: qwen/qwen-2.5-coder
```

CLI flags such as `--harness qwen` and `--model <id>` can override or supply
missing executor values.

## Local OS access

Declare `os_env` only for agents that need local file/shell tools.

```yaml
os_env:
  type: caller_process
  cwd: .
  sandbox:
    type: linux_bwrap
    write_paths:
      - .
    allow_network: true
```

For trusted local development, examples may use `sandbox.type: none`:

```yaml
os_env:
  type: caller_process
  cwd: .
  sandbox:
    type: none
```

Prefer the narrowest filesystem and network access that supports the task. Do
not pass secrets through the environment unless the tool genuinely needs them.

You usually don't need to choose a `sandbox.type` — omit it and Omnigent picks
the platform default (`linux_bwrap` on Linux, `darwin_seatbelt` on macOS), so the
same YAML works across platforms. For the full set of sandbox options, how to
share one policy across `sys_os_*` and terminals, and how to set up network
egress rules, see the `sandbox:` examples below and the sandbox source under `omnigent/inner/`.

## Tools

Tools are declared under `tools` by name.

### MCP server

```yaml
tools:
  github:
    type: mcp
    command: uv
    args:
      - run
      - python
      - -m
      - my_package.github_mcp
    tools:
      - search_issues
      - get_pull_request
```

MCP tools can also point at a remote URL:

```yaml
tools:
  docs:
    type: mcp
    url: https://example.com/mcp
    headers:
      Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}
```

### Python function tool

```yaml
tools:
  summarize_file:
    type: function
    description: Summarize a local text file.
    callable: my_package.tools.summarize_file
    parameters:
      type: object
      properties:
        path:
          type: string
      required: [path]
```

For client-provided tools, use `runtime: client` and do not set `callable`.

### Tool sandbox containers

Local Python tools can run inside a container image by declaring a sandbox image.
Use `container_image` for new specs; `docker_image` remains accepted as a
deprecated alias for backwards compatibility. Set `container_runtime: podman` to
run the image with Podman instead of Docker.

```yaml
tools:
  sandbox:
    container_image: python:3.12-slim
    container_runtime: podman  # optional; defaults to docker
```

### Sub-agent tool

```yaml
tools:
  reviewer:
    type: agent
    description: Review proposed code changes.
    prompt: |
      You are a careful code reviewer. Focus on correctness, tests, security,
      and maintainability.
    executor:
      harness: claude-sdk
      model: databricks-claude-sonnet-4-6
    os_env: inherit
    pass_history: true
    max_sessions: 2
```

Each sub-agent picks its own `executor.harness` and `model`, so an orchestrator
can mix harnesses by role — e.g. a `cursor` coder with a `claude-sdk`
reviewer:

```yaml
tools:
  coder:
    type: agent
    executor:
      harness: cursor      # Cursor model id (e.g. gpt-5, auto), not a databricks-* id
      model: gpt-5
```

Use `tools.<name>: inherit` to inherit a tool from a parent agent, or
`tools.<name>: self` / `spec: self` for a sub-agent that clones the parent spec.

## Policies

Policies can inspect requests, responses, tool calls, and tool results.

```yaml
policies:
  pii_guard:
    type: function
    handler: my_package.policies.pii_guard
    on: [request, response]
```

A factory can be configured with `factory_params`:

```yaml
policies:
  workspace_policy:
    type: function
    handler: my_package.policies.make_workspace_policy
    factory_params:
      allowed_hosts:
        - example.cloud.databricks.com
```

## Terminals

Terminals are named interactive shell environments that the agent can launch.

```yaml
terminals:
  bash:
    command: bash
    args: [-l]
    os_env: inherit
    allow_cwd_override: true
    allow_sandbox_override: false
    scrollback: 10000
```

Use `os_env: inherit` to give the terminal the same sandbox as the agent, or
alias a shared `sandbox:` block so `sys_os_*` and the terminal enforce the same
policy. Keep `allow_sandbox_override: false` unless you intend to let the
launcher weaken the sandbox at launch time.

## Complete example

```yaml
name: coding_agent
prompt: |
  You are a coding agent. Inspect files before editing, run targeted tests, and
  summarize changes with validation results.

executor:
  harness: claude-sdk
  model: databricks-claude-sonnet-4-6
  auth:
    type: databricks
    profile: oss

async: true
cancellable: true

os_env:
  type: caller_process
  cwd: .
  sandbox:
    type: linux_bwrap
    write_paths: [.]
    allow_network: true

terminals:
  zsh:
    command: zsh
    args: [-l]
    os_env: inherit
    allow_cwd_override: true

tools:
  repo_search:
    type: function
    description: Search repository files for a pattern.
    callable: my_package.tools.repo_search
    parameters:
      type: object
      properties:
        query:
          type: string
      required: [query]
```

## Validation tips

- Keep examples free of secrets, workspace URLs, customer data, and private
  Databricks-only configuration unless the example is explicitly internal.
- Prefer `instructions: AGENTS.md` for long prompts that are shared with other
  tooling.
- Start from a bundled example such as `examples/polly/config.yaml` or
  `examples/debby/config.yaml` and remove tools you do not need.
- Run the YAML before publishing it:

  ```bash
  omnigent run path/to/agent.yaml -p "Say hello"
  ```
