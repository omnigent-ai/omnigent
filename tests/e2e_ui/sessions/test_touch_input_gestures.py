"""E2E: touch input across the web shell.

The user-facing claims, each driven here with real (CDP-synthesized)
touch input against the live SPA:

1. **Pane dividers are mouse-only.** Every resize hook binds ``onMouseDown``
   only, so a finger/stylus drag on a divider never resizes the pane. Driven
   on the left Conversations sidebar's right-edge handle: a touch drag that a
   mouse drag of the same geometry performs must change the sidebar width.

2. **Session rows expose no swipe affordance.** A deliberate horizontal swipe
   on a sidebar session row must produce *some* swipe response — the row
   tracking the finger (a transform appearing on the row while the gesture is
   in flight) or a committed swipe action (an ``archived`` PATCH). Today the
   gesture is dead: nothing moves and nothing fires.

3. **Long-press on a session row doesn't reliably open the row menu.** The
   row is wrapped in a Radix ``ContextMenuTrigger`` (which serves long-press
   on touch via the browser's contextmenu gesture) while dnd-kit's
   ``TouchSensor`` (250ms hold, 8px tolerance) arms a drag on the same
   pointer. A perfectly stationary hold happens to work, but a hold with a
   realistic few-px finger wobble — inside dnd-kit's own declared tolerance —
   opens nothing, which is exactly the "randomly does nothing" flakiness the
   report describes.

4. **Capability checks drift between call sites.** On a hover-incapable touch
   tablet the sidebar header's actions are visible (they carry the
   ``[@media(hover:hover)]`` guard) while the session row's actions kebab is
   still purely hover-revealed — the same device gets different touch
   treatment from adjacent components.

All four drive their own touch-enabled contexts (the default ``page``
fixture has no touch support). Touch gestures are dispatched through CDP
``Input.dispatchTouchEvent`` so they run Chromium's real gesture recognizer
(pan/long-press/compatibility-mouse semantics), exactly as a finger would.
